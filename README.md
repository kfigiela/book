#The glorious Luna 1.0 Alpha documentation!

Welcome to the Luna documentation. Please mind that this document is a mix of a tutorial and a formal specification and it often relies on examples and intuitive description. We strongly believe that tutorials are easier to read and understand that adequate formal documents.

###Current state of the art
Please mind that both the official Luna compiler as well as this documentation concern Luna first public release. We have done an enormous amount of work to bring Luna to the reality, however, by no means neither the tool-set nor documentation could be considered to be complete. Its foundations (as described below) are done, however there are many of minor details to be added in.

This specification describes both the Luna specification, including syntactic and semantic rules as well as the current status of the Luna compiler. If a language element is not yet fully supported by the compiler, appropriate note is included in this document.

Luna is intended to be a production language, not a research language, incorporating at the same time many recent innovations in programming language design. We love to receive feedbackd Please let us know what you like and what needs improvement. This will help us refine the language and decide on priorities of its evolution.
