#The glorious Luna 1.0 Beta documentation! 

Welcome to the Luna documentation. Please mind that this document is a mix of a tutorial and a formal specification and it often relies on examples and intuitive description. We strongly believe that tutorials are easier to read and understand that adequate formal documents.

###Current state of the art
Please mind that both the official Luna compiler as well as this documentation concern Luna first public release. We have done an enormous amount of work to bring Luna to the reality, however, by no means neither the tool-set nor documentation could be considered to be complete. Its foundations (as described below) are done, however there are many of minor details to be added in.

This specification describes the Luna specification, including syntactic and semantic rules and describes the current status of Luna compiler. You will find some language elements, that are not yet supported by the compiler -- they will be tagged with appropriate information. Please let us know what you like and what needs improvement. This will help us refine the language and decide on priorities of its evolution.

## About this document
This document covers the textual Luna representation and the official Luna compiler ecosystem. The visual representation can be used with the Luna Graphical Environment (LGE) and will be covered in a separate document.
